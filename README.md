# Peerway
A peer-to-peer social media platform for mobile that doesn't store data on servers.

## Components
Peerway consists of two main components.
- The mobile app itself (written in JS with React Native)
- A NodeJS server for establishing peer-to-peer connections over the internet.

## Running the app
You can build and run this app using react-native-cli; for more information, see https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device

You should have the server running before you use the app if you wish to access other users on your network, e.g. in the command line
```bash
node ./Peerway/server
```
